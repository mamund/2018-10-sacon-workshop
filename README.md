### Main Ideas
 * The role REST can play in microservice design
 * The importance of stable interfaces in front of changing code
 * The value and challenges of supporting runtime discovery
 * How you can design for emergent adaptability w/o adding needless complexity

### Description:
What are RESTful Microservices and why would you want to build them?  In this session you’ll learn how to to design and implement adaptable microservices that take advantage of the features of REST including statelessness, self-description, and using hypermedia to discover and modify application state.

A RESTful Microservices approach can improve the stability and resilience of services, reduces the need for extensive changes and redeployment when the domain model changes, and greatly increases the flexibility of individual services including the ability to automatically work with other newly-discovered services.

RESTful Microservices have certain characteristics and they have a clear set of dependencies on a system environment that supports runtime discovery and service-binding. Essentially services need to resolve dependencies automatically at runtime. Even service instances they have never before "met." 

This session offers valuable lessons and advice for, service designers, developers, and software architects.

### Instructor Bio
An internationally known author and speaker, Mike Amundsen travels the world consulting and talking about network architecture, Web development, and other subjects. As Director of Architecture for the API Academy, he works with companies to provide insight on how best to capitalize on the opportunities APIs present to both consumers and the enterprise. 

Amundsen has authored numerous books and papers. His 2013 collaboration with Leonard Richardson "RESTful Web APIs" and his 2011 book, “Building Hypermedia APIs with HTML5 and Node”, are common references for building adaptable Web applications. He co-authored "Microservice Architecture" (June 2016) and his latest book, "RESTful Web Clients", was published by O'Reilly in February 2017.
