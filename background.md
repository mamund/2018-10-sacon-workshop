## RESTful Microservices from the Ground Up - Background

### Who is this presentation for?
 * Service designers, software architects, and developers

### Prerequisite knowledge
 * A working knowledge of Node.js and implementing services on the web
 * Familiarity with microservices

### Materials or downloads needed in advance
The workshop relies on "table-top" exercises using stickynotes and colored pens. However, there _may_ be some code examples shown. If you'd like to access the github repository that holds the code examples and other related material, you can use the following:

 * A laptop with Node.js and the text editor and coding environment of your choice installed
 * A GitHub account
 * A Heroku account (optional)
 
### What you'll learn
 * Understand the role REST can play in microservice design, the importance of stable interfaces in front of changing code, and the value and challenges of supporting runtime discovery
 * Learn how to design for emergent adaptability without adding needless complexity
