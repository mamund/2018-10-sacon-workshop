## Adaptability Exercise

In this exercise, you need to make changes to your service (based on the updated Story file for your service) and make sure these changes are reflected in your ALPS document and (optionally) in your WSD flow diagram. You may also need to update your shared registry entry _and_ check for any other changes for any service to which you are binding.

These are the steps to complete this exercise:

 * Read through the updated story document for your service
   * Mark your service as _offline_ by adding a red circle over your green one)
   * Take a small token
   * Make the needed changes to the list of data points
   * Make the needed changes to the list of actions
   * Update/Replace your SERVICE-PAGE with the data point and action changes
   * Make sure you have an ALPS document that relects the latest data/actions for your story
   * Publish any ALPS content changes to the shared registry
     * update/replace your stickynote with the latest unique id and ALPS id
   * Mark your service online by adding a green circle over your current red circle
   * Take a large token
 * Check the shared registry for any change to your existing (dependent) service bindings and, if your service bindings have changed (see ALPS id and/or service id) changed:
   * Mark your service offline by adding a red circle over your green one
   * Take a large token
   * Make any changes to your service to account for changes in your binding by modifying your ALPS document if needed (this means you use a new ALPS id).
   * If needed, republish your own ALPS document (generate a new ID)
   * Mark your service online by adding a green cirlce over your red circle
   * Take a large token
   * _Repeat this for each service binding you are using until all dependent services are updated._
