## Adaptability Exercise

In this exercise, you need to make changes to your service (based on the updated Story file for your service) and make sure these changes are reflected in your ALPS document and (optionally) in your WSD flow diagram. You may also need to update your shared registry entry _and_ check for any other changes for any service to which you are binding.

These are the steps to complete this exercise:

 * Read through the updated story document for your service
   * Make the needed changes to the list of data points
   * Make the needed changes to the list of actions
   * Optionally, update your service WSD to reflect the new data/actions
   * Make sure you have an ALPS document that relects the latest data/actions for your story
   * Publish any ALPS content changes to the shared registry
   * Mark your service online (take a large token)
 * Check the shared registry for any change to your existing service bindings and, if your service bindings' ALPS document(s) changed:
   * Mark your service offline (take a large token)
   * Make any changes to your service to account for changes in your binding
   * If needed, republish your own ALPS document
   * Mark your service online (take a large token)
   * Repeat this for each service binding you are using
