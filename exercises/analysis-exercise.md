## Analysis Exercise

In this exercise, select a BigCo story and perform the following tasks:

 * Identify all the unique data points to store/retrieve
   * Focus on data storage including whether storage is yours (local) or someone else's (remote)
 * Identify all the unique actions to perform
   * Include all input arguments
   * Include all output arguments/objects/lists
   * Indicate whether the action is safe (read-only) or unsafe (modifies storage)
 * Start your SERVICE-PAGE by adding the following information to it:
   * TOP-LEFT: Name of your story (Customers, Accounts, PostalCode, SalesRep)
   * TOP-RIGHT: Unique ID (make up your own, try using a URL/URI)
   * BOTTOM-LEFT: List of all unique data points (rep-name, id, etc.)
   * BOTTOM-RIGHT: List of all action names (read, write, listbyId, etc.)

_NOTE: do not think-about or document anything related to protocol (HTTP, Thrift, etc.), resources (URLs), or format (JSON, XML, etc.)_
