## Analysis Exercise

In this exercise, select a BigCo story and perform the following tasks:

 * Identify all the unique data points to store/retrieve
   * Focus on data storage including whether storage is yours (local) or someone else's (remote)
 * Identify all the unique actions to perform
   * Include all input arguments
   * Include all output arguments/objects/lists
   * Indicate whether the action is safe (read-only) or unsafe (modifies storage)

_NOTE: do not think-about or document anything related to protocol (HTTP, Thrift, etc.), resources (URLs), or format (JSON, XML, etc.)

Optionally, produce a WebSequenceDiagram (http://websequencediagrams.com).
