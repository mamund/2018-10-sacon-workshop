## Design Exercise

In this exercise, you will use the results of your BigCo, Inc. story analysis to produce an ALPS design document.

These are the tasks you need to perform to produce your ALPS design document:

 * Using Schema.org, update all your data names as needed to make sure all data names match a schema.org entry
 * Update/Replace your SERVICE-PAGE with the new data names
 * Create an ALPS document (JSON or XML) that reflects your latest story analysis

_See [CreditCheck Service ALPS](sample/credit-check-alps.xml) for an example_
