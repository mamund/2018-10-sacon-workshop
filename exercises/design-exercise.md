## Design Exercise

In this exercise, you will use the results of your BigCo, Inc. story analysis to produce an ALPS design document.

These are the tasks you need to perform to produce your ALPS design document:

 * Using Schema.org, update all your data names as needed to make sure all data names match a schema.org entry
 * Update your WebSequenceDiagram w/ the new data names (Optional)
 * Create a new ALPS document (JSON or XML) that reflects your updated story analysis

_NOTE: Do not worry about protocol (HTTP, Thrift, etc.), resources (URLs), or format (JSON, XML, etc.) details. Just indicate ALPS types (semantic, safe, unsafe) for now._
