## Discovery Exercise

In this exercise, you will publish your service to a central registry (in this workshop, that will be a whiteboard or wall in the training room) and you will also use that registry to "find and bind" to any external services _your_ service needs in order to complete it's task.

These are the steps to you need to complete for this exercise

 * Publish your service to the shared registry by adding a stickynote to the whiteboard that has the following:
   * Your unique id (from the SERVICE-PAGE)
   * Your ALPS id (from the SERVER-PAGE)
   * Mark your service as _offline_ to start by pasting a red circle on the stickynote. 
   * Take a small token
 * If your service depends on others to function (e.g. you use other services), do the following _for each service_ you need to use:
   * Search the shared registry to locate one or more services that can supply what you need
   * Confirm the service uses the protocol you need (in this workshop all will use HTTP)
   * Confirm the service supports the message format you need
     * For each time you need to go back to another team to negotiate a different format, take a large token
   * Retrieve the ALPS document (in this workshop, ask the other team for a copy or URL pointer)
     * For each data point you have to clarify w/ another team, take a small token
     * For each action you have to clarify w/ another team, take a large token
   * Incorporate the binding into your service (in this workshop that means updating your SERVICE-PAGE to include a stickynote with the unique name of the remote service (CENTER-MIDDLE)
   * Confirm you have added the proper stability patterns for each added service binding by adding a colored sticker (with the initial on it) directly on the stickynote for that service)
 * Publish your service to the shared registry using the following:
   * A unique identifier for your service
   * An ALPS URL to indicate your service vocabulary
   * Mark your service online by covering the red circle with a green one
   * Take a large token

_Note: You may discover that some service you need is not listed in the registry. In this case, you should still publish your service and then continue to check the registry until the service you need appears. At that point, you need to go through the entire discovery process again (including publishing your service again). Repeat this until all service bindings are covered._
