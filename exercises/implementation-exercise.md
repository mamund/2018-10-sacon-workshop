## Implementation Exercise

In this exercise, you will determine the type of service you will be building along with the protocol and format to use for requests and resposnes. For this workshop, the only protocol we will use is HTTP.

These are the tasks to complete for this exercise:

 * Determine the type of service you are building (S-P-A):
   * **S** = Stateless
   * **P** = Persistence
   * **A** = Aggregator
 * Add your services MSType string to your SERVICE-PAGE (TOP-MIDDLE)
 * Select the input/output format(s) your service will support:
   * HTML 
   * Collection+JSON
   * Siren
   * HAL
   * Atom
   * OData
   * JSON
   * XML
 * Add a sticky note (with the format name on it) to your SERVICE-PAGE for each supported format
