## Stability Exercise

In this exercise, you need to identify all the Nygard Stability patterns that you need to apply to your service implementation. Remember that which patterns you need to apply is determined by the MS Type you are building (Stateless, Persistence, Aggregator).

These are the tasks to perform:

 * Confirm your MSType (S-P-A)
 * Select one or more stability patterns from this list that should be applied to your service
   * Timeout
   * Circuitbreaker
   * Bulkhead
   * Steadystate
   * Failfast
   * Handshaking
 * Add a colored round sticker to your SERVICE-PAGE for each of the patterns your service implements.
 * Optionally, discuss and record possible ways in which you can implement the selected stability patterns (e.g. technologies to use, services (SaaS or local), code patterns, etc.)
